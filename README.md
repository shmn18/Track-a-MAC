The aim of this project is to create a solution that allows us to track MAC numbers connect to our network.This will be
done by probing the network switches periodically, and retrieving their forwarding table. With this information we can 
search for a specific mac addres. If its a match, it should return switches, vlans and ports on the MAC address and 
identify the connection port.
